## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/portfolio.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd portfolio

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install

## Steps to Run Locally

1. Start the development server:

 ```bash
 npm start
This will open the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000. The page will reload when you make changes, and you may also see lint errors in the console.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

   `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes, and any lint errors will be shown in the console.

`npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
For more information, see the section on running tests.

`npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
This creates an optimized production build for the best performance. The build is minified, and filenames include hashes for efficient caching. Your app is ready to be deployed!

For more details, see the deployment documentation.

`npm run eject`
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you're not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project, copying all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (e.g., webpack, Babel, ESLint) directly into your project so you have full control over them.

Once ejected, all of the commands except eject will continue working but will point to the copied scripts, which you can tweak. You are responsible for configuring the build system after this.

We recommend you don't eject unless you need to customize your build setup. Most users can use the curated configuration that Create React App provides.
